# Go Problem Sheet 3
My name is Cian Hatton, I'm currently in my 3rd year studying Software Development at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie/).

I created this repository to hold my solutions to this [problem sheet](https://data-representation.github.io/problems/go-regexp.html) on regular expressions in Go.

This is problem sheet e for the [Data Representation and Querying](https://data-representation.github.io/) module.

All solutions are written in the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language.

In order to run the files, first clone the repository.

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/CHatton/Go-Problem-Sheet-e.git
```

Make sure that you have the [Go compiler](https://golang.org/dl/)  installed.

Navigate to the folder of the file you want to run.

```bash
> cd src
```

You can run the program by either first building it.

```bash
> go build <file-name>
```

And then running the executable.

```bash
> ./<file-name>
```

Or you can simply use the command

```bash
> go run <file-name>
```
